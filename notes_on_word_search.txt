we need a new path /word_search

filtered verb will always be GET

new parameter taken called "word"
http://host:port/path?param=value&param2=value2

http://127.0.0.1:9292/word_search?word=value

def word_search


the value for this parameter could be a fragment
path is going to include the word

word_search = word.value

will need to require "../usr/share/dict/words"

file for parameters
take it in .downcase

output:

if words.include? == true

  WORD is a known word
  "#{word.upcase} is a known word"

  WORD is not a known word
  "#{word.upcase} is not a known word"
