# instantiate listening to the server
# set a visited counter to be updated with each visit to the server

# within loop
# allow client = whatever the server accepts
# update the visited counter

# confirm readiness for a request and takes in the lines fed to server until there are no more lines

# inspect the lines and provide that as part of the response

# In order to send response back
# three variables == response, output (which prints out the response), headers
# actually needs to print out header and output
# also, instruct to print out headers and output
# instruct to close

# only have client has closed, can we stop the loop

# confirmation message that it has ended
